Mumbai take a different approach, absolutely stomping the lawn as they run out. Gambhir's taking guard, and Malinga is measuring his run-up. No slips.  7.55pm Two of the four batsmen Harbhajan has dismissed most often in the IPL (four times) are Gautam Gambhir and Manish Pandey. The other two are Suresh Raina and Dwayne Smith. Both Pandey (6.00) and Gambhir (6.46) score at less than seven an over against Harbhajan.  An extension of that last stat: we might see an over from Malinga, an over from McCleneghan and then spin against Lynn in the Powerplay. Run-rate 4.90 against left-arm spin and 3.33 against right-arm spin in the Powerplays. He's been dismissed thrice by left-arm spinners in the PP.  7.50pm Ten minutes from start and here's something to chew on: Chris Lynn can be destructive against right-arm pace - he has scored at a run rate of 10.93 against them - but hasn't been as good against other kinds of bowling - left-arm pace (7.93), left-arm spin (6.16) and right-arm spin (7.05).   7.47pm Since the start of the 2015 season, the last-five-overs run rate at the Wankhede is 11.59, the second-most of all IPL venues behind Brabourne Stadium (12.16).  Timothy: &quot;I think it's absolutely rubbish that they don't play Shakib Al Hasan. Since Sunil Narine's change in bowling action, he's looked less threatening. He should've been replaced by Shakib.&quot; ---- Shakib's also earned a rest, though - series in NZ, India and Sri Lanka leading up to the IPL.  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="3">7.40pm: Mumbai Indians XI: Parthiv Patel (wk), Jos Buttler, Rohit Sharma (c), Nitish Rana, Krunal Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Harbhajan Singh, Mitchell McClenaghan, Lasith Malinga, Jasprit Bumrah Knight Riders XI: Gautam Gambhir (c), Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa (wk), Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan, Suryakumar Yadav, Chris Woakes, Kuldeep Yadav, Ankit Rajpoot, Sunil Narine, Trent Boult  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="4">And on the flip side: Uthappa v Harbhajan - 75 runs off 43 balls (SR of 174.4), 2 dismissals  Here's speculation on why Chawla may have been dropped: Rohit Sharma v Chawla - 122 runs off 96 balls (SR of 127.08), 1 dismissal. That's the most Rohit has against any bowler in the IPL.  </P></page>

For KKR, medium-pacer Ankit Rajpoot replaces Piyush Chawla.  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="1">7.30pm Mumbai Indians have won the toss and elected to field.  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="2">7.28pm Not too far from the toss now. In eight of 12 games at this venue in the last two years, teams batting first have posted above 170. However, teams batting first lost all four games at the Wankhede in IPL 2016.   </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="3">Some nice numbers if you're a Kolkata fan: At this venue in 2016, spinners took 16 wickets at 20.12, economy of 7.00, as opposed to pacers who took 26 wickets at 34.30, economy of 8.52   Zabin: &quot;how likely is Shakib to play?&quot; --- He's with the team, but they might not be willing to change a winning combination.  Mustafa Moudi: &quot;Both these sides scored exactly 184 in the last match. The only difference is KKR was way too brutal by scoring it in just 14.5 overs without losing a wicket&quot;  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="4">And more from Vishal: 'The stands are pretty packed already. Lights are flashing, the music is blaring, people are sweating…a usual IPL day at Wankhede'  7.20pm Our man Vishal Dikshit reports from Mumbai: 'The two teams are warming up. Malinga, Harbhajan, Bumrah and McClenaghan bowling next to the pitch. That means Southee will probably have to sit out. It's the Wankhede so, obviously, SRT getting all the attention. He's right next to the pitch. First L Balaji has a chat with him, then KP walks up to him and now Jacques Kallis has joined him.'  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="5">SKA: &quot;Saurabh for Rayadu, Malinga for Southee, and Bhaji for Krunal Pandya. Though i am tempted to give Krunal a game, unless the team think tank is looking at Karn Sharma. Jos should open with Parthiv&quot;  Rahul: &quot;@Vivek Replace the injured Rayadu with Bhajji and you have the most balanced team of the IPL. Also Malinga replaces Southee &quot;  </P><P Lang="en-US" MCID="6">Rishav: &quot;IPL should seriously have away team captain decide whether to bat or bowl instead if toss. With home and away games it will even things out at the end. Batting second is a very big advantage and luck of captains at toss could decide IPL.&quot;  </P></page>

According to me it should be as follows: Rohit, Parthiv, Saurabh Tiwary, Hardik, Krunal, Jos Buttler, Pollard, Southee, Harbajan, Malinga, Bumrah. Batting depth, plus bowling expertise, plus firepower to score quick.&quot;  7pm Welcome to the second game of double-header Sunday. It's Mumbai Indians versus the Kolkata Knight Riders. On the face of it, it's Kolkata with all the momentum today; a ten-wicket victory in their last game and a batting performance so ruthless, Gujarat Lions still haven't recovered. On the other hand, Mumbai had their hearts broken in the last over by Steven Smith a few nights ago. The bigger picture undoes those outcomes. Mumbai have a 13-5 win record overall against Kolkata. It's 5-1 at the Wankhede, which is today's venue. The last three encounters between these teams were won by Mumbai. There's also the small matter of Lasith Malinga, who is returning fresh from a hat-trick against Bangladesh a few days ago: if he plays, he'll be bowling to a side with a top and middle order that, literally, hasn't faced a ball yet in this tournament. Daunting, isn't it? Will this be where the hosts take off in IPL 10? Or should we just live in the moment and give KKR the respect they earned the other night?
